# Data Analyst Tools

This section contains documentation for RusticAI's Data Analyst tools and agents, which provide capabilities for data analysis, visualization, and insights generation.

## Overview

The Data Analyst components of RusticAI enable agent-based data analysis workflows. These tools allow you to:

- Process and analyze structured and unstructured data
- Generate visualizations and reports
- Extract insights from diverse data sources
- Build automated data pipelines
- Create interactive data dashboards

## Features

- **Data Processing Agents** - Agents specialized in data cleaning, transformation, and preparation
- **Analysis Tools** - Statistical analysis and pattern recognition capabilities
- **Visualization Generation** - Create charts, graphs, and visual reports
- **Automated Insights** - Extract and summarize key findings from data
- **Integration with Data Sources** - Connect to databases, APIs, files, and web sources

## Getting Started

To use the Data Analyst components, you'll need:

1. RusticAI core framework installed
2. Python data science libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.)
3. Access to relevant data sources
4. Proper configuration of the data analyst agents in your guild

### Basic Example

```python
from rustic_ai.core.guild.builders import GuildBuilder, AgentBuilder
from rustic_ai.data_analyst.agents import DataAnalysisAgent, DataVisualizationAgent

# Create the data analysis guild
analysis_guild_builder = GuildBuilder("DataAnalysisGuild")

# Add data analysis agent
analysis_agent = AgentBuilder(DataAnalysisAgent) \
    .set_name("analysis_agent") \
    .set_description("Performs statistical analysis on input data") \
    .build_spec()

# Add visualization agent
viz_agent = AgentBuilder(DataVisualizationAgent) \
    .set_name("visualization_agent") \
    .set_description("Creates visualizations from analyzed data") \
    .build_spec()

# Add agents to guild
analysis_guild_builder.add_agent_spec(analysis_agent)
analysis_guild_builder.add_agent_spec(viz_agent)
```
